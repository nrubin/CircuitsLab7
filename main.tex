\section*{Current as a function of voltage}
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{The differential pair circuit used in this experiment.}
\label{fig:Schematic}
\end{figure}

In this experiment, we constructed an \nMOS differential pair, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Schematic}. We set the bias voltage, \Vb, to $0.5V$, and set $V_2$ to a range of voltages, from $1V$ to $4.5V$, sweeping $V_{DM}$ from $-30mV$ to $+30mV$. Each of these three data series, with $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_1 - I_2$ and $I_1 + I_2$ can be seen plotted on one figure, in Figure \ref{fig:AllCurrentsOneFigure}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Figures/AllCurrentsOneFigure}
\caption{The relationship between $I_1$ and $I_2$, shown through a range of different vales of $V_{DM}$ and \Vgb. Note that $V_2$ has no noticeable impact upon the voltage-current characteristic}
\label{fig:AllCurrentsOneFigure}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:AllCurrentsOneFigure}, the current through $M_1$ and $M_2$ change significantly as $V_{DM}$ moves away from $0V$. As $V_{DM}$ increases, $I_1$ increases and $I_2$ decrease. For a decrease in $V_{DM}$, the opposite is true. Meanwhile, changing $V_2$ has no visible impact on the current-voltage characteristics.

% V2 changes? Also include a plot showing the common-source node voltage, V , as a function
% of V1
% −V2 for all three values of V2. How does the value of V change as V1 goes from below
% V2 to above it?

% In your report, include a single plot showing I1, I2, I1−I2, and I1+I2, as a function of V1−V2 for all three values of V2 that you used. Do these current–voltage characteristics change signiﬁcantly asV2 changes? 




\section*{Common-source Node voltage}
% Also include a plot showing the common-source node voltage, V , as a functionof V1−V2 for all three values of V2. How does the value of V change as V1 goes from below V2 to above it?

From the pre-lab, we expect the common-source node voltage $V$ to operate according to the following equation:

\begin{equation}
V = \kappa (\textrm{max}(V_1,V_2) - V_b)
\label{eq:nodevoltageeq}
\end{equation}

In this first experiment, we set \Vtwo while adjusting \Vone, so we expect a graph of the $V$ as a function of \Vdm to be constant when $V_{dm} < 0$ and to follow \Vone when $V{dm} > 0$. We in fact see this in figure \ref{fig:nodevoltageWI}, where $V$ is plotted as a function of \Vdm for three values of \Vtwo.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Figures/NodeVoltageWeakInversion.eps}
\caption{Node voltage as a function of the differential mode voltage. Governed by equation \ref{eq:nodevoltageeq}, we see $V$ follow \Vtwo (which was constant for each separate experiment) when $V_{dm} < 0$ and follow \Vone when $V_{dm} > 0$.}
\label{fig:nodevoltageWI}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:nodevoltageWI}, when $V_{dm} < 0$, we see that $V$ is set to a constant value, and when $V_{dm} > 0$, we see it rise almost linearly. The behavior when $V_{dm} < 0$ is explained by $V$ following a function of \Vtwo, and since \Vtwo is constant in these experiments, the value of $V$ remains constant. When $V_{dm} > 0$, we see $V$ increase linearly, which is explain by the fact that we were adjusting \Vone linearly, and $V$ follows \Vone. The relationship seems to interpolate smoothly between $V_{dm} < 0$ and $V_{dm} > 0$.


\section*{Incremental Transconductance Gain}

The incremental transconductance gain of a differential pair, \gdm, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
G_{dm} = \frac{\partial I_{dm}}{\partial V_{dm}}\bigg|_{V_{dm} = 0}
\label{eq:gdm}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ l | l  }
        V2 (Volts) & $G_{dm} (\Omega^{-1})$ \\
        \hline
        2 & $ 4.6576 \times 10^{-5}$ \\
        3 & $ 4.7823 \times 10^{-5}$ \\
        4 & $ 4.8015 \times 10^{-5}$ \\
        \label{tb:gdm}
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Various Values of \gdm for a given \Vtwo}
\end{table}

To solve for \gdm, we plotted \Idm and a function of \Vdm, and fit a straight line to the linear region of the graph, where $V_{dm} \approx I_{dm}$. The graph can be seen in figure \ref{fig:gdm}, while each value of \gdm compard to \Vtwo is in table 1.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Figures/Gdm.eps}
\caption{Plot of \Idm as a function of \Vdm for three values of \Vtwo, as well as lines representing \gdm. The slopes in the linear regions change very little relative to \Vtwo, which is a result of the differential pair circuit revolving mostly on \Vdm, which doesn't change with \Vtwo.}
\label{fig:gdm}
\end{figure}


As is visually obvious in figure \ref{fig:gdm}, the slopes of the linear regions of the \Idm vs. \Vdm plot change little with \Vtwo, which is a property of the differential pair circuit. From table 1 we see that $G_{dm} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{-5}$, with the largest amount of error around $V_2 = 2 V$, but the magnitude is so small it could be attributed to experimental error.

% Now, set the bias voltage, Vb, so that the bias current is above threshold. For a singlevalue of V2 that is far enough away from the power supply rail to keep the bias transistor saturated, perform these same measurements. You might want to increase slightly the rangeover which you sweep V1− V2 for these measurements. Make plot similar to the ones thatyou made for the lower bias current. How does the behavior of the circuit change as the biascurrent changes from weak or moderate inversion to strong inversion?

\section*{Bias Transistor in Strong Inversion}

In the below experiments, we set \Vb to 1 Volt, which put the bias resistor into strong inversion. We collected values for \Ione, \Itwo, and $V$ for only one value of \Vtwo, and explored the same currents and voltages as before.

\subsection*{Various Currents and \gdm}

In figure \ref{fig:AllCurrentsStrongInversion}, we plotted \Ione, \Itwo, \Idm, and \Icm as a function of \Vdm, as well as an extracted value for \gdm ($2.3458 \times 10^{-4} \Omega^{-1}$). Most obviously, we see the currents in this plot reach a higher and lower limit, due to \Ib being higher (as the bias transistor is in strong inversion.)

One important note is how much wider the linear region of the \Idm vs. \Vdm plot is in strong inversion than in weak inversion (0.2 Volts in weak inversion to 0.4 volts in strong inversion).

\subsection*{Node Voltage}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Figures/NodeVoltageStrongInversion.eps}
\caption{The node voltage follows the larger voltage!!}
\label{fig:nodevoltageSI}
\end{figure}

In strong inversion, the node voltage follows a similar trend as previously discussed for weak inversion; as \Vdm increases, the node voltage also increases. Similar to weak inversion, the data seem to support two linear regions, one with slope zero, where \Vdm is negative, and a second, positive region where the slope is $\kappa$. Because of the scale of the figure, it appears that the effect is larger than weak inversion, however the change is in fact consistent. In weak inversion, the node voltage increased by roughly $0.2V$ for a $300mV$ increase in \Vdm. In this strong inversion case, the node voltage increases by roughly $0.5V$, over an increase of $700mV$, a similar slope to that of weak inversion.
